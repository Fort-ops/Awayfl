# forkphorus iFrame Embed
### (This ones a fork of their own embed but with more url params.)

An easily embeddable url-query based page for the forkphorus Scratch Player.

## Why?
Well this one is probably the most useless in this collection, it's basically
an exact fork of [their github pages repo](https://github.com/forkphorus/forkphorus.github.io) BUT it has support for sprite fencing using url parameters.
I'll make a pull request and if it goes through I'll redirect this.
Some very hacky code was done to this version though, sorry forkphorus devs.

## Setup
Using this is as easy as just making an iframe with your project ID in it!

### Working example
```html
  <iframe width="800px" height="600px" src="https://embedabbl.zombienw.com/forkphorus/index.html?id=191452192&auto-start=true&light-content=false&sprite-fencing=true&ui=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```
