# JSDos iFrame Embed

An easily embeddable url-query based page for the JSDos Emulator.

## Why?
JSDos is great but setting up to just put a simple game on your web page can be slightly annoying.
While they do have an embed tool, it takes a bit more work than just linking a url. 
So, I've made the whole process as easy as making an iframe.

## Setup
Using this is as easy as just making an iframe with your rom in it!

### Working example
```html
  <iframe width="800px" height="600px" src="https://embedabbl.zombienw.com/jsdos/index.html?jsdos=https://embedabbl.zombienw.com/jsdos/test.jsdos" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```
