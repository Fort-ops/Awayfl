## Why?
The internet is full of awesome platforms for playing games. This repo makes an attempt at making embeding some of these platforms a little easier.

## Usage
Open the directory of each "core" and read the readme for examples.

## Plan
The plan down the road is to add more "cores" and refactor all "borrowed" code, as well as make a library of some sort.
